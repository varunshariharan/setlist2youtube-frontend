## üìã **Video Script & Structure**

### **Opening (0:00 - 0:30)**
```
"Hi, I'm demonstrating Setlist2YouTube, a Chrome extension that converts 
setlist.fm pages into YouTube playlists. Today I'll show you exactly how 
it uses YouTube OAuth scopes to create personalized playlists."
```

### **Setup & Context (0:30 - 1:00)**
```
"I'm on a setlist.fm page for Steven Wilson's recent concert. This page 
contains a setlist with 14 songs. Without the extension, I'd have to 
manually search YouTube for each song and create a playlist - that could 
take hours. Let me show you how the extension automates this process."
```

### **Extension Activation (1:00 - 1:30)**
```
"I'll click the Setlist2YouTube extension icon. Notice that the extension 
detects we're on a setlist.fm page and shows the current setlist information. 
At this point, no YouTube access is required yet."
```

### **OAuth Permission Request (1:30 - 2:00)**
```
"Now I'll click 'Convert to YouTube Playlist'. This is where the OAuth 
flow begins. The extension requests permission to access my YouTube account. 
Let me show you exactly what permissions are being requested."
```

**Show OAuth consent screen with scope explanation**

### **Scope Usage Demonstration (2:00 - 3:30)**
```
"Once I grant permission, the extension uses the YouTube Data API to:
1. Search for each song in the setlist
2. Find the best matching videos
3. Create a new playlist on my YouTube account
4. Add all the videos in the correct order

Let me show you this happening in real-time."
```

**Show the extension working:**
- Search progress for each song
- Video selection process
- Playlist creation
- Video addition

### **Results & Verification (3:30 - 4:00)**
```
"Perfect! The extension has created a playlist called 'Steven Wilson ‚Äì 
Setlist at La Riviera, Madrid, Spain' with all 14 songs. Let me open 
this playlist to show you the final result."
```

**Show the created YouTube playlist**

### **Privacy & Security Summary (4:00 - 4:30)**
```
"Important to note: The extension only accesses what's necessary for 
playlist creation. It doesn't read my viewing history, personal information, 
or other playlists. All data is stored locally on my device, and I can 
revoke access anytime through my Google Account settings."
```

### **Closing (4:30 - 5:00)**
```
"That's Setlist2YouTube in action! It uses YouTube OAuth scopes responsibly 
to transform setlist information into personalized playlists, saving users 
hours of manual work while maintaining privacy and security."
```
