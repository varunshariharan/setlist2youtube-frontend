# Know The Show â€“ Frontend (Chrome Extension)

This repository contains the Chrome extension that converts a setlist from setlist.fm into a playable YouTube playlist.

- Refer to the PRD in the parent workspace: `../setlist2youtube_prd.md`.
- Milestones: extension skeleton, DOM detection, setlist parser, YouTube API integration, playlist creation UI, testing & release.

Basic structure per PRD:
```

```

Testing plan and CI will be added as we implement features.
